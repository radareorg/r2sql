# r2xsql

(wip, r2sql repo will soon be renamed to r2xsql).

SQL interface for [radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2), powered
by [`libxsql`](https://github.com/0xeb/libxsql).

```sql
SELECT name, size FROM funcs WHERE name LIKE 'main%';
SELECT text     FROM strings WHERE text LIKE '%password%';
UPDATE comments SET text = 'reviewed' WHERE addr = 0x1234;
```

`r2sql` exposes radare2's analysis state as live SQL virtual tables: every
query re-issues the JSON form of the relevant r2 command (`aflj`, `izj`,
`axtj`, …) against an in-process core (`r_core_cmd_str`) or a spawned
`radare2 -q0` pipe — no flat dump, no stale snapshot.

## Two flavors

r2sql builds in two flavors from one source tree:

| Flavor | Binary | What it is | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **pipe-only** (default) | `r2sql` | portable single binary; **spawns and manages `radare2`** over a pipe (`--r2pipe`). No `r_*.dll` imports. | `radare2` on PATH at runtime |
| **full** (libr) | `r2sql-full` (+ `core_r2sql` plugin) | embeds radare2 in-process (`r_core_cmd_str`), fastest, and adds the in-r2 `sql` plugin | a built radare2 (`-DRadare2_ROOT=<prefix>`) |

The pipe-only `r2sql` is **always built**. The full `r2sql-full` + plugin are
built additionally when you pass `-DR2SQL_BUILD_FULL=ON`. Both expose the exact
same SQL surface, CLI, and HTTP/MCP servers. MCP support is gated behind
`R2SQL_WITH_MCP=ON` (fastmcpp dependency).

## Build

```powershell
# Pipe-only r2sql (default) — portable, needs radare2 on PATH:
cmake -S . -B build/r2sql -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build/r2sql --config Release

# Also build the full flavor (r2sql-full + core_r2sql plugin):
cmake -S . -B build/r2sql -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 \
  -DR2SQL_BUILD_FULL=ON -DRadare2_ROOT=<radare2 install prefix>
cmake --build build/r2sql --config Release
```

A single configure with `-DR2SQL_BUILD_FULL=ON` produces **both** `r2sql` and
`r2sql-full` (+ the plugin). This is the standalone build; it also builds cleanly
when vendored as a subdirectory of a larger project — the `CMakeLists.txt` here
detects the situation and adapts.

## Backends

| Backend | When to use |
|---|---|
| `LibrBackend`   | In-process, fastest. Default when r2sql was built with `R2SQL_HAVE_LIBR=1`. |
| `R2PipeBackend` | Spawns `radare2 -q0` and communicates over stdio. Default fallback; force with `--r2pipe`. |
| `MockBackend`   | In-memory mock: canned command→response map, records issued commands — for embedding/offline use without a live radare2. |

## Skills (Claude Code / Codex)

`r2sql` ships an agent-skills package —
[`r2sql-skills`](https://github.com/0xeb/r2sql-skills) — that teaches Claude Code
and Codex to drive it: query and annotate radare2 analysis through SQL, pick the
right backend, and reach the HTTP/MCP servers. Install it from the plugin
marketplace in that repo to point an agent at `r2sql`.
