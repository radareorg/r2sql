r2sql-full — radare2 drop-in (overlay, embedded/libr flavor)

Extract this archive ON TOP OF your radare2 install prefix (the directory
that contains bin/radare2[.exe]). It adds:

  bin/r2sql-full[.exe]          full CLI + HTTP/MCP server (in-process libr)
  ${REL_PLUGIN}/core_r2sql.*    in-r2 plugin (load inside r2: L core_r2sql.<ext>)

Because r2sql-full then sits next to radare2[.exe], the libr backend finds
radare2's data dir (share/) automatically, so the 'types' table and
ordinal imports resolve fully.

Usage:
  r2sql-full -s <file> -q "SELECT name FROM funcs LIMIT 5"
  radare2 <file>     then inside r2:   sql SELECT * FROM funcs

(For a portable build that needs no co-location, see the pipe-only r2sql.)

Built against radare2 ${R2_REF}.
EOF

cat > dist/pipe/README.txt <<EOF
r2sql — pipe-only single binary

A standalone r2sql[.exe] with NO radare2 libraries linked. It drives
radare2 over a pipe (--r2pipe), so it only needs radare2[.exe] somewhere
on PATH at runtime. Place it anywhere.

Usage:
  r2sql -s <file> -q "SELECT name FROM funcs LIMIT 5"

Built against radare2 ${R2_REF} (API-compatible r2 on PATH is sufficient).
